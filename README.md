# university_student_retention_analysis
Using MySQL workbench, created a low-code university student retention analysis (Completed Spring 2024)

This was a semester-long project in a technical project management course (Information Systems and Analytics Capstone). My group and I were assigned to create and demonstrate a low-code application to solve a specific business issue. The AV department needed a way to track student retention rates and see the factors that may contribute the most. 

My personal contributions to the project are Stages III-VI in their entirety, covering the development of the Visio diagrams and models, the SQL database, the Access connection through ODBC, and the Bubble.io frontend.
